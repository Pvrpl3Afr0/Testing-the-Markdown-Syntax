# Ideas for an SOF Hackathon
Mr. Irimina had the audacity to suggest having a small "Hackathon" at SOF, involving arduinos and other small forms of robotics. He didn't give me many details but upon consideration it might actually be fun. Some things we could do include:
1. Who can build the "best" car using arduinos and DC motors
2. Who can design the best app to solve an actual challenge that we face at SOF?
* What challenges do we face as high schoolers? middle schoolers?
3. More coming soon
This brings us to our next order of business, is it open to only high schoolers or the whole school? Who's invited? How long will we do this for?
It'd be *great* to spend 12 hours in the computer lab...
That's it for now!
